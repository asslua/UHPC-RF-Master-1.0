# UHPC-RF-Master-1.0

The UHPC-RF-Master is a software package that simulates chemically reacting systems with real-fluid effects incoporated in a robust manner via high-order mixture Virial Equation of State and ab initio two- to multi-body intermolecular potentials.

Currently, it contains the following reactor modules, with more under development:

1. Constant-Volume Reactor Module

2. Perfectly-Stirred Reactor Module
